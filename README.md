Gaussian provide full probabilistic prediction, and an estimate of uncertainty in the prediction. This can be useful in some situations, SVM's are often prone to unbiased classification datasets (say when you have way more positive examples than negative ones), GPs don't usually suffer from this problem. SO the accuracy we got from the Gaussian is greater than that of SVM.
